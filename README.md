# Lung Cancer Detection using CNN
📌 Project Overview

 The model will classify lung tissue into different categories, such as:Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect lung cancer from medical images (such as CT scans or X-rays).

Benign Lung Tissue (Non-cancerous)

Lung Adenocarcinoma (A common type of lung cancer)

Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Another type of lung cancer)

Colon Adenocarcinoma (A form of colon cancer)

Colon Benign Tissue (Non-cancerous colon tissue)

This project follows a structured deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, CNN model development, training, evaluation, and deployment.

🎯 Objectives

Develop an automated deep learning model for lung cancer classification.

Use CNN architectures to extract meaningful patterns from medical images.

Improve model accuracy through data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and transfer learning.

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deploy the trained model using a web-based application for easy accessibility.

🗄️ Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled medical images categorized into different cancerous and non-cancerous types. We use publicly available datasets such as:

LUNA16 (Lung Nodule Analysis)

NIH Chest X-ray Dataset

Kaggle Datasets (Search for "lung cancer detection")

🔬 Methodology

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Load the dataset and inspect sample images.

Resize, normalize, and apply image augmentation techniques.

Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

CNN Model Development

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional layers.

Use pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet) for transfer learning.

Implement softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Model Training & Evaluation

Train the CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

Evaluate the performance using confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and accuracy plots.

Deployment

Develop a web-based interface using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Allow users to upload medical images and receive classification results.

📊 Model Performance Metrics

To evaluate the CNN model, we analyze:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.

Precision & Recall: Ability to correctly classify cancerous vs. non-cancerous cases.

F1-score: Balance between precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of classification performance.

Grad-CAM Visualization: Highlights areas where the CNN focuses on detecting cancerous regions.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Deep Learning Frameworks (CNN, Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation)

🚀 Future Improvements

Implement 3D CNNs for better lung nodule detection.

Incorporate explainable AI techniques to interpret CNN predictions.

Extend the model to multi-modal data (e.g., clinical reports + images).

Fine-tune the model with more diverse datasets to improve generalization.
